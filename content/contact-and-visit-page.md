## Contact Page

In order to give people a suite of choices for contacting us, I've added a **Contact** page. It will only be accessible via the footer, or direct links, as to discourage people from using it for general questions that should instead go through the Contact _Form_.

The contact page features three Quick Links at the top, to direct users to useful pages where they might find the answers to their questions. The contact info itself is in the middle, next to a map embed.

Below that is yet another contact form, giving users an accessible option. And at the very bottom is a list of links for technical feedback.

## Visit Page

I've also redesigned the **Visit** page, making it more accessible and consistent with the design of the Contact page.

The Visit page features four Quick Links, to direct users to things that will be useful for their visit, or things they might want to check out before coming.

Below that is a Google Maps Plaform embed, allowing users to directly open navigation. If they do not use Google Maps (such as Apple Maps users), they can click the address on the right to copy it.

Under the map and general info, the hours of operation are displayed, giving users a chance to check the hours right on the page. And at the bottom is a few Frequently Asked Questions that will likely serve useful
