## Authentication
I've opened the subdomains so that they no longer use Vercel Authentication, but instead browser-based Basic Authentication middleware.

This allows you, the staff, to sign in to subdomains like `preview.oldmcdonaldspumpkinpatch.com` or `admin.oldmcdonaldspumpkinpatch.com` with a **username** and **password** given to you by the dev.

_If you're reading this, then you've already got the credentials._

## Preview Dashboard
You're currently using the Preview Dashboard, which will include small blurbs like this explaining updates, and links to their previews.

This is how I will communicate with clients in future projects, but I figured I should take it for a test run on here too.

In the future, I'll be adding **feature branch tracking**
